# Pop_OS Settings

## Enable fractional scaling

This is currently disabled by default in Pop_OS 20.04 (as of 2020-08-01). System76 is working on fixing upstream bugs in 
Ubuntu/Gnome before re-enabling it by default, but it can be switched back on. On some screens this is crucial. See 
[Github issue thread](https://github.com/pop-os/gnome-control-center/issues/89) for detail.
