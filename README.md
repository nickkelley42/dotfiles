# Nick Kelley Dotfiles

Hello, Future Nick. If you're reading this, you're probably on a new system trying to figure out what the hell is going 
on. Have no fear! I'm (making an attempt at) scripting the hell out of it so all of your sweet-ass customizations can be 
put in place easily. Simply run:

```
$ ./install-dotfiles
```

...and you should be good to go! I will set it up so that the script will prompt for any environment-specific settings.  
For example, it doesn't make sense to do GNOME tweaks on a Mac.

Installation is broken up into subdirectories; see the subdirectory README files for more details.
